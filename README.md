# Ruby Coin Slide

### By Meaghan Jones and August Von Trapp, July 2016

## Description 

Have you seen those coin slides used by cash registers that automatically return the correct amount of change? We built a Sinatra website that lets a user enter an amount of cents and shows the smallest number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies needed to make that change.
